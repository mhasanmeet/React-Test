## Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test driven development is a software development process where you write tests before writing the software code

Once the test have been written, you then write the code to ensure the tests pass. This process involves three steps;

1. Create tests that verify the functionality of a specific feature
2. Write software code that will run the tests successfully when re-executed
3. Refactor the code for optimizing while ensuring the tests continue to pass 

This process also called red-green testing as all tests go from a red failed state to a green passed state

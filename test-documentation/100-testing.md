## Testing 

As a developer, When we build something, we need to ensure that our software and code works perfectly. 

For that we need to test our code. 

## Manual Test

Initially/casually we do test our code manually. 

After coding we just interact our output in a browser which is actually a manual testing.  

Drawbacks:

* Time consuming 
* May have human error
* Chance to forget test some part of the code or feature

## Automated Test

Automatically test by write code

Advantages:

* Not time consuming
* Reliable and consistent
* East to identify and fix feature

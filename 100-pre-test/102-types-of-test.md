## Types of tests

* Unit tests
* Integration tests
* End to End tests (E2E) 

### Unit tests

* Unit test focus is on testing the individual building blocks of an application such as a class or a function or a component. 

* Each unit or building block is tested in isolation, independent of other units

* Dependencies are mocked 

* Run in a short amount of time and make it very easy to pinpoint failures

* Relatively easy to write and maintain

### Integration tests

* Integration test focus is on testing a combination of units, and ensuring they work together. 

### E2E test 

* End to End tests is on testing the entire application flow, and ensuring it works as designed from start to finish. 

* involves in a real UI, a real backend databases, real services, and more.

* Take the longest time as they cover the most amount of code. 

* Have a cost implication as you interact with real APIs that may charge based on the number of requests.
